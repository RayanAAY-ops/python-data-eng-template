# Python Data Engineering Project Template

## Overview

This repository provides a **Python Data Engineering Project Template** that serves as a guideline for structuring data engineering projects using best practices. It includes a well-defined directory structure, essential configuration files, and a standardized workflow to streamline development and ensure maintainability.

## Purpose

The goal of this template is to:
- Help data engineers quickly set up new projects with a consistent structure.
- Promote best practices in code organization, testing, and documentation.
- Serve as a reference for using Docker and Terraform in data engineering projects.

## Features

- **Well-defined directory structure**: Organizes code, data, configurations, and tests for clarity and ease of navigation.
- **Docker support**: Containerizes the application for consistent environments across development and production.
- **Makefile**: Provides convenient commands for common tasks like creating a virtual environment and installing dependencies.
- **Configuration management**: Uses a dedicated folder for configuration files to keep the project clean and manageable.
- **Testing framework**: Encourages the use of unit tests to maintain code quality and reliability.
